# Rollercoaster Model
The aim of this repository is to create a model to rate how thrilling rollercoasters are based on a couple of factors. rollercoasterModel.py contains python code which utilizes scikit learn to train a Random Forest Decision Tree regressor on the data in the csv. I tried a number of other models, including a Support Vector Regression and a deep neural network, but opted to use the decision tree for the final model because it yielded the best performance. The other models which were not used are commented out. A Grid Search was used to optimize the parameter number of estimators for the decision tree. The final result/ goal of the program is a function called rate_rollercoaster which takes as arguments all of the different attributes of the rollercoaster being considered in the model and gives as an output an excitment score.
